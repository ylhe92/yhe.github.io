== Brief Biography

I am a postdoctoral scholar in [https://www.seas.harvard.edu/ SEAS] and [http://harvardcgbc.org/ CGBC] at Harvard University working with [https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/ Prof. Na Li] and 
[https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/person/ali-malkawi/ Prof. Ali Malkawi]. I received the B.S. and M.E. degrees in Department of Automotive Engineering from [http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/ Tsinghua University], 
Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2015. In Feb. 2019, I received the DPhil (Ph.D.) degree in Control from the [http://www.ox.ac.uk/ University of Oxford] for my work on / 
[zheng_thesis.pdf Chordal Sparsity in Control and Optimization of Large-scale Systems] / under the supervision of Professor [http://sysos.eng.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/User:Antonis Antonis Papachristodoulou]. 
I am broadly interested in learning, optimization, and control of network systems, and their applications to autonomous vehicles and traffic systems. 

I will be joining the [http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/ Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering] at [https://ucsd.edu/ UC San Diego] as an Assistant Professor in July 2021.
